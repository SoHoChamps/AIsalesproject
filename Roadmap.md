## Phase 1: Initial Build (May 2–6) 
- Chatbot UI (basic flow, questions, data capture)
- Dashboard UI (initial page with KPIs, structure, placeholder charts)
- Frontend layout with sidebar navigation and multi-page simulation

---

## Phase 2: Core Functionality + Architecture (May 7–8)
- Add multiple pages to the dashboard using sidebar navigation
- Implement modular routing logic or tab system to switch views
- Connect chatbot responses to a local JSON file or simple database
- Load interview data dynamically into the dashboard

---

## Phase 3: NLP API & Data Processing Integration (May 8–9)
- Integrate a basic NLP API (e.g., OpenAI, Cohere) or mock logic
- Develop backend logic to:
  - Analyze user responses
  - Extract sentiment, keywords, and themes
  - Store results for frontend visualization
- Link processed data to dashboard charts

---

## Phase 4: Visual Analytics + Charting (May 9–10)
- Create charts using Chart.js or similar library:
  - Sentiment over time
  - Keyword frequency
  - Optional: Word cloud or clustering visualization
- Ensure charts dynamically update based on loaded data

---

## Phase 5: MVP Finalization & Testing (May 11)

- Perform full functionality test: chatbot → backend → dashboard

- Debug layout issues and logic inconsistencies

- Polish UI/UX: loading indicators, mobile responsiveness, minor fixes
